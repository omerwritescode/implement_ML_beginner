# Implementing ML in Python (sample)

This is a dummy project file showcasing the implementation of select machine learning models using Python.
The respective jupyter and CSV files have been pushed (uploaded) in this repository.


Version 1:
We begin with our dataset named 'music.csv' that contains music preferences of people over the years, and how they change.
Our aim here is to train our model such that it can understand this shift in music taste and predict the music preference for a certain age group.
We import this model into the jupyter file and we use a 'Decision Tree Classifier' algorithm to train our model.
